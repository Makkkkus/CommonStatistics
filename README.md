# CommonStatistics
A small Minecraft plugin that gives the server player statistics from other servers.

# What is the point
Well, the pont of this project is to create a database everyone can access with information about players. If a player is hacking and gets banned it will log the ban to the database. When the player joins another server it would know the player's history and it could limit the player's access.
